Case Study

4.  What resources (papers, web-sites, tools) will you use?

Generating the proof:

We will start with the simplest program for arithmetic coding that we can (specified length, infinite length integers) and try to do a proof. If we succeed we will try increasing the usefulness of the program, and consequently the complexity, by implementing it with fixed length integers, or a more efficient way to terminate at the proper length.

For simpler proofs we may try to prove by hand and verifiy proof with a checker like Metamath or we may use a verification tool, either PVS or Boogie (Microsoft). The more complicated version would definitely need a verification tool.
